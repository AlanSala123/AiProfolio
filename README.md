## Project Overview

Add a quick summary of what your project theme and objectives are. 

Users will be able to input information relevant to their career paths, upload their resume, and also any preferences in terms of features of the website or aesthetics. That information will be taken and used to generate an interactive website to showcase the skills outlined in the users resume. The user will be able to download their files, view them through this website, or deploy them externally.
