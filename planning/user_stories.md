## Problem Statement

  In today's digital age, professionals across industries are seeking a more efficient and visually appealing way to showcase their skills, experience, and accomplishments. Traditional resumes, while informative, often lack the capability to fully capture a person's professional narrative in a way that is easily digestible and engaging. Simultaneously, creating a personal portfolio website from scratch requires coding knowledge or using time-consuming website builders, which can be a deterrent for individuals who are not tech-savvy or lack the necessary time. Moreover, with the increased competition in the job market, it's crucial to have an accessible, comprehensive, and visually pleasing online presence to attract potential employers and network. 
  The target audience for our web application encompasses a wide range of individuals who seek to establish a robust online professional presence. This includes recent graduates and early-career professionals who are just stepping into the job market and are looking for a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. It also encompasses mid-career and senior professionals who want to provide a holistic view of their career journey and showcase their in-depth project details, achievements, testimonials, and detailed career timelines. Our application will also serve freelancers and consultants who need to continuously display their work and attract new clients, as well as job seekers in creative fields like design, writing, and photography, for whom a portfolio website is an excellent platform to display their creativity and work samples. Non-technical individuals who lack coding knowledge or experience but want a personalized website to present their professional selves online will find our application incredibly useful. Lastly, our web application will cater to academics and researchers, enabling them to share their research work, publications, and contributions to their field.
