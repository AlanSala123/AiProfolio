## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to implement the MVP for our project

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 A challenge we faced was part of the process of our website is generating portfolio websites but for some reason the information from their resume was coming in, but not styled, we were able to fix it.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We were able to finish all of our taks for the sprint plan this week

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources provided helped prepare in planning and executing our capstone project, I think a very great help was the resource given to us about color theory becuause then we can implment that into our portfolio website generation so the colors it provides are accessible.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature that we would consider at risk is allowing the users to edit their portfolios because we are currently just trying to add more templates and make them look nice and we don't know if we'll get to that feature of letting the user cutomize their portfolio.
