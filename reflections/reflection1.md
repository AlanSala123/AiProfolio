## Reflection Questions

* Add at least one succesful thing about this week

 A successful thing about the week is we were able to finish our JSON web tokens, and we were able to get over 85% coverage on all the backend tests.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Mock testing was a challenge and the API script for the chatgpt model, and the UI libraries(research).

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yeah we were able to finish all the sprint plans for the week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The resources provided that definitely helped in planning was trello, because we were able to plan all the tasks and we all know what we were working on at a given time.  Furthermore, the flex topic on github was extremely useful because it helped us with our workflow and how to work as a group on a git project.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features that we would consider at risk is deploying the generated templates using an external website, if this remains we will change our plan by not offering an option to deploy using an external website.
