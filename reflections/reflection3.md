## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 One successful thing about this week was we were able to implement mocks into our unit tests!  Because previously we had unit tests pinging our database and tests were taking awhile to run, but now they run in about a second!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges that we faced was building some of the props for our product because we ran into css styling errors, but we were able to figure it out.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We didn't quite finish all of our tasks in the sprint plan for the week and the biggest reason was some features that we initially thought would only take a couple of hours took a lot longer.  We plan to use the weekend to catch up on the last remaining features that will be implemented in our website.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yeah the resources provided helped prepare in planning and executing the capstone project this week, and one thing that we found particularly useful was advice given to us about how to present because it really helped in presenting our demo this friday.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Some of the features that we would consider at risk is implementing the "forgot password" feature into our application and we won't add this feature to our website if we run too short on time.
